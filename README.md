# Newspaper Project with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize

This project focuses on creating a newspaper application using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize ORM. The application provides RESTful API endpoints for managing authors and their posts.

## API Endpoints

### Postman Api Documentation link: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28564197/2s9Y5Zvh1A

The project features some main endpoints:

1. `/api/v1/authors`: This endpoint is used for authors. When making a `POST` request to this endpoint, the following parameters are required:
   - `email`: Email of the author (must be unique).
   - `name`: Name of the author.
   - `password`: Password for the author (minimum 8 characters).

   **Example Request:**
   ```http
   POST /api/v1/authors
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "email": "author@example.com",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "password": "securepassword"
   }

# Newspaper Project Setup and Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- pnpm (Package Manager, recommended)

To install `pnpm`, run the following command:

```npm install -g pnpm```


# Getting Started with Newspaper Project

To begin working with the Newspaper Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code directly:

Alternatively you can also use `npm`

4. Start the project:

- For production:

  ```
  pnpm start
  ```

- For development (with nodemon):

  ```
  pnpm run dev
  ```

Alternatively, you can use `npm` for the above commands.

## Additional Information

Here are some important points to note:

- The project utilizes Sequelize ORM for database interactions.
- We recommend using `pnpm` as the package manager due to its benefits.
- Make sure to secure your environment variables and database credentials.
